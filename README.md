[Orthospell](http://web.archive.org/web/20161010154412/http://tools.diorama.ch/orthospell.html) is based on hunspell (uses original dll) and modified version of the original extman.lua (without spawner_ex.dll). It requires shell.dll to run! NOTE original website dead. There was a PDF manual (missing).
